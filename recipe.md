# Instructions

1. Coat the inner surface of the custard cups with unsalted butter.
2. Pour the caramel in the custard cups.
3. Crack the two eggs into a bowl. Lightly beat the eggs with a whisk. Avoid creating too much foam.
4. Add the milk and sugar in a pot. Turn on the burner. Stir with a spatula until all the sugar is dissolved.
5. Add the milk to the beaten eggs while whisking it.
6. Sieve the mixture with a mesh strainer. Remove any foam on the surface with a spoon.
7. Gently fill the custard cups with the mixture.
8. Cover the cups with aluminum foil. The foil will prevent the surface from getting dry and will also help steam the pudding evenly.
9. Heat water in a pan and gently place the cups in it. There should be enough hot water to cover the bottom half of the cups. Put the lid on.
10. Keep the water temperature just below the boiling point and steam the pudding for 18 to 20 minutes. Do not bring the water to boil otherwise the smooth texture of the pudding will be lost.
11. Remove the custard cups. When they become cool, store them in the fridge. Scrape the side of the cup with the tip of a knife. Tap the cup on a kitchen towel to make a space around the pudding.
12. Your custard pudding is ready!
