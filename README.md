Custard is a culinary preparation based on milk or cream cooked with egg yolk, and sometimes also flour, corn starch, or gelatin. 
The most common custards are used in custard desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla.
Savoury custard is also used to prepare bobotie, which is the national dish of South Africa.
Custard is usually cooked in a double boiler, or heated very gently in a pan on a stove or can be steamed.
